### 4chan tumblr theme
This is a 4chan look alike Tumblr theme I built to match preferences for my personal website www.kanthalaraghu..com. You can see a live version here: http://kanthalaraghu.tumblr.com

 ### Features include

* Support for all post types and most of their special tags
* Semantic, HTML5 markup.
* Disqus comments
* Custom Google Font
* Pre-included Yotsuba favicon

Here's the [documentation](http://https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) to create a custom tumblr theme. You can make one too...

I hope to share this with anyone who thinks this theme is nice and... well, wants it.
